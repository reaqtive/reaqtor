We'll get to this detail in a bit, but let's first apply the rewrite to our query expression."

        "This library provides very rudimentary support for continuation passing style (CPS) transforms of code which can be used in the context of binding query execution plans to asynchronous infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** The CPS transform support in this library only works for expressions because it originates from a LINQ provider toolkit we wrote in the .NET 3.5 days, prior to support for statement nodes. A full-blown CPS transformation framework existed in the context of Volta's tier splitting work, but it was written in CCI (the Common Compiler Infrastructure) and never got ported to .NET 4.0's expressions. While Nuqleon doesn't use this implementation of CPS transform directly (anymore), we're keeping it around for other uses (e.g. execution plans in some internal stores). A more complete CPS transformation framework could be built, especially in conjunction with the work on modernized expression trees with support for async lambdas and `await` expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "CPS transforms involve rewriting method invocations such as `Add(a, b)` to `Add(a, b, ret => ...)` where the result is provided through a callback rather than a returned result. This then enables the use of asynchronous functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** This functionality has been used for execution plans in stores that have asynchronous callback-based `Get`, `Read`, `Enumerate`, etc. operations, but the user's code uses synchronous operations instead. By enabling rewrites to synchronous stub methods (e.g. `T Get<T>(string key)`) and annotating these stubs with a `UseAsyncMethod` attribute, the CPS transformation framework performs a set of tree rewrites that replace the stub method calls with their async counterparts (e.g. `void Get<T>(string key, Action<T>)`)."
