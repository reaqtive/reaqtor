# Nuqleon

Nuqleon provides a set of libraries which are reusable beyond Reaqtor. Many of these libraries have been used to implement other services. The libraries can be categorized in four big buckets:

* BCL - A set of .NET Base Class Library extensions including collections, memory management, reflection APIs, etc.
* DataModel - An implementation of a structural data model based on the JSON type system of primitives, arrays, and objects.
* JSON - Libraries to work with JSON, which are also used for Bonsai expression tree serialization and DataModel serialization.
* LINQ - Libraries to work with expression trees, including visitors, optimizers, Bonsai serialization, and more.
