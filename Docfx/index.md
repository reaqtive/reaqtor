# Reaqtor

Reaqtor is a framework for creating reliable, stateful, distributed, and scalable event processing based on Rx.

Reaqtor is composed of 3 layers:

- [Reaqtor](/api/reaqtor/) - platform level services for building reliable, stateful, distributed reactive solutions.
- [Reaqtive](/api/reaqtive/) - reactive primitives that evolve many of the concepts found in Rx.
- [Nuqleon](/api/nuqleon) - reusable components that provide compiler and LINQ extensions.
