    // Random note on edges:
    //
    //   Edges enable peer-to-peer management of 1-to-1 or 1-to-N streams between query engines used to support splitting of
    //   queries, which may either be necessary due to affinity requirements (e.g. an observable or observer or operator does
    //   only exist on some engines) or to support scaling. Some examples:
    //
    //     xs.A().B().C().Subscribe(o)
    //
    //   Suppose that B is only available on engine 1, while A and C are available everywhere. But xs is only available on
    //   engine 2 and o is only available on engine 3. In such a case, we need to split the query, with a few options that are
    //   available:
    //
    //     xs.A().Subscribe(t1) on engine 2
    //     t1.B().Subscribe(t2) on engine 1
    //     t2.C().Subscribe(t3) on engine 3
    //
    //   is one of the options. Others involve moving A() and C(), which can run anywhere. The decomposition requires the creation
    //   of intermediate 1-to-1 streams t1, t2, and t3 to flow events across engines. A query coordinator can come up with this
    //   decomposition by analyzing affinity for artifacts (observables, observers, etc.) and resource availability on engines.
    //   There are many ways to materialize the "execution plan". One is to create three global streams, three queries, and keep
    //   track of all of these by keeping a mapping of the top-level subscription to these resources (in order to support deletion).
    //   An alternative is to define t1, t2, t3 in engines, and have the resolver/edge mechanism do the peer-to-peer resolution
    //   (which can be a pure function if the URI for such streams includes a QE's URI as a prefix), as well as tear down of
    //   upstream/downstream resources upon completion or disposal (which reduces the burden on the QC).
    //
    //   However, edges are limited, especially when dynamically growing query operator graphs are involved (e.g. SelectMany) or
    //   when sharing of common subexpressions is warranted (though this is a 1-to-N case which works reasonably well with edges).
    //
    //   Two examples:
    //
    //   1. Suppose xs.A() occurs often across different queries. We may want to create a stream t1 and publish the results of
    //      the common subquery xs.A() into t1 by placing a subscription xs.A().Subscribe(t1) somewhere. Various queries that
    //      need the result of xs.A() can now replace it by t1, which is a 1-to-N multicast point. Lifetime of t1 is now governed
    //      by a reference count, which could be managed by the engine running the query publishing into t1, by counting the
    //      number of downstream consumers that have come in via (output) edge-based reliable subscriptions. However, the QE has
    //      a lot of bookkeeping to do (besides the ref count), because all consumers may be at diferent sequence IDs. This has
    //      worked in practice, albeit with "operator local storage" to make storage of outgoing sequenced events more efficient
    //      than an opaque (potentially huge) blob in checkpoint storage. Nonetheless, there's also a lot of work to manage
    //      the connections between engines. At some point, it just becomes easier to have the stream backed by an external
    //      event pub/sub system such as Service Bus or Event Hub, which also allows for higher degrees of fan-out and higher
    //      reliability (not tied to the upstream engine's availability).
    //
    //   2. Consider a query with a higher-order operator, e.g. xs.A().SelectMany(x => ys(x).B()).C().Subscribe(o). For each
    //      event produced by xs.A(), an inner subscription ys(x).B() is made. Depending on the lifetime of ys(x) instances
    //      (i.e. if/when these produce OnCompleted) and the event volume of xs.A(), this may exceed the limits of what a single
    //      engine can do. Edges can be put to work to support this, by having ys(x) resolve to another engine, causing bridges
    //      to be created. However, there are some limitations to consider. First, current support for edges isn't data-
    //      dependent, so we resolve based on ys, and not the value of x. So the resolver target would be a reactive service
    //      that should be a service group (or at least something backed by multiple engines); otherwise, if the target of ys
    //      is a single QE, we've just pushed the problem down one level. In other words, we need to delegate to a component
    //      that can make placement decisions. Second, the original QE is still the one that runs xs.A().SelectMany(...).C(),
    //      where ... is scaled out, but the "merge" into C() still happens locally. In various cases, we also want that piece
    //      to run elsewhere. As such, it's often turned out more advantageous to let the query coordinator rewrite occurrences
    //      of higher-order operators such as SelectMany in such a way that all "inner" artifacts (in case of SelectMany, that
    //      is inner subscriptions; for things like GroupBy and Window, that is subjects) rendez-vous with itself for lifecycle
    //      management, e.g.:
    //
    //        QE1               runs   xs.A().Subscribe(t1)
    //        QE2               runs   t2.C().Subscribe(o)
    //        QC (any of them)  runs   t1.Subscribe(x => { ... CreateSubscription(@[ys(x).B().Subscribe(t2)]); ... }, ...)
    //
    //      That is, the QC sets up streams t1 and t2. The former is used to receive upstream events, which trigger the creation
    //      of the inner subscriptions (which can be subject to placement logic, or further decomposition). Additional hooks are
    //      inserted through expression rewriting in order to observe the completion of inner subscriptions, again by calling up
    //      to the QC to keep track of the active inner subscriptions (which have unique IDs). In other words, the QC is taking
    //      over the coordination of `SelectMany` by means of creating an execution plan where it is in control of all of the
    //      lifecycle events, allowing it to keep track of all resources (streams t1 and t2, subscriptions in QE1 and QE2, and
    //      the dynamically changing list of inner subscriptions). Note that the QC is itself a distributed service backed by
    //      a state store (e.g. in CosmosDB) the keeps track of the resources and the top-level mapping of the user's subscription
    //      to all of the underlying resources. Note that this corresponds to a persisted representation of the IDisposable
    //      algebra in classic Rx (e.g. CompositeDisposable). Finally note that even for query execution like the one sketched
    //      here, edges can play a role, e.g. in a QE receiving a ys(x).B().Subscribe(t2) subscription, where ys and t2 can be
    //      bound to edges (though t2 would typically have been rewritten into an observer that refers to an external stream).
